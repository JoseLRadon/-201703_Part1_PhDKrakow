\item The most troublesome photoelectric interactions will be those with the shielding, usually lead. There is a significant possibility that this fluorescent X-ray may escape the shielding and that it will be detected by the detector: generation of a number of X-ray peaks in the gamma spectrum in the region 70–85 keV (problems for low energy measurements that may be solved with Cd and Cu)

{\small
\begin{itemize}
\item Gamma spectrometry using germanium detectors is the best technique for identifying and quantifying radionuclides. This is due to the very sharply defined and characteristic energies of gamma-rays which are produced by the great majority of radionuclides. 
\item There are a small number of ‘pure beta emitters’, which do not emit gamma radiation. These cannot be identified by gamma spectrometry ($^{3}$H, $^{14}$C, $^{90}$Sr). 
\item X-ray energies will tell you the element present, but not which isotope. 
\item Decay schemes give vital information on whether gammas are in ‘cascade’. This has great significance in true coincidence summing.

\item[Lower level discriminator (LLD)] pulses below this level will not be analysed. Use this to reject electronic noise and low-energy X-rays
\item [Upper level discriminator (ULD)] pulses above this level will not be analysed. Use this to reject very high energy pulses. This will often be left at its maximum, but still performs a useful function in rejecting high- energycosmic gamma-rays
\item [ADC zero level]  use this to adjust the energy calibration so that it passes through 0 keV. Not ideal for eliminating the effect of noise
\item [Digital offset] this is a means of shifting the spectrum to lower channel numbers by subtracting a fixed number (the offset) from every channel number output by the ADC 
\item [Conversion range] the maximum pulse height the MCA can accept, typically 10 V
\item [ADC resolution] is the total number of channels available within the ADC. It varies from model to model, but MCAs for germanium systems might incorporate a 16k (16384), 8k (8192), or 4k (4096) channels ADC

\item[Absolute full energy peak] relation between the peak area in our spectrum to the amount of radioactivity it represents. This relates the peak area, at a particular energy, to the number of gamma- rays emitted by the source and must depend upon the geometrical arrangement of source and detector
\item[Absolute total efficiency] relates the number of gamma rays emitted by the source to the number of counts detected anywhere in the spectrum. This takes into account the full energy peak and all incomplete absorptions represented by the Compton continuum
\item[Intrinsic efficiency] relates the counts in the spectrum to the number of gamma rays incident on the detector. This efficiency is a basic parameter of the detector and is independent of the source/detector geometry. It is also called full energy peak or total

In principle, the statistics of radioactive decay are binomial in nature. If we were to toss a handful of coins onto a table and then examine the arrangement, we would find coins in one of two dispositions – heads up or tails up.
